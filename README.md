I will show you how to Sync A Website Or Webpage Theme With OS's Preferred Color Scheme, Dark Mode, And Light Mode using only CSS. We can call this feature CSS Automatic Night Mode And Day Mode. As you can see, without any page refresh, my website automatically switches by my OS setting between Dark Mode And Light Mode. With a simple CSS Media query, we can detect if the user has set their system to use a light or dark color theme. This CSS trick works on most Desktop and Mobile Devices that support Dark Mode And Light Mode features. Also, I'm gonna show you how you can detect a user's color scheme mode by CSS and display it on a Web page. If you want the theme to change smoothly, just add a CSS transition property for the body selector.
